  </h3>
<h1 style ="color:white;font-size:100%">I am a graduate of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign(UIUC) with a degree in technology management. During my time at UIUC, I invested time and effort in researching business practices. Before I came to UIUC, I joined Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC), the largest aerospace enterprise in Taiwan.
<p>At AIDC, I was a member of the Canadian Bombardier CL-350 Project Management Team. My main duty was to execute the content of purchase orders obtained by our sales team. In effect, I communicated across the board and pulled relevant resources and department personnel together. I also monitored weekly meetings in order to understand progress and resolved issues to ensure the target will be met.</p></h1>
